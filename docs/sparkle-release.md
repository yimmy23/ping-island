# Sparkle Release Setup

## Signed GitHub Actions releases

The repo ships `.github/workflows/release-packages.yml` for GitHub-hosted release packaging.

- It runs on `macos-15`.
- It imports your `Developer ID Application` certificate into a temporary keychain.
- It archives and exports the app through `./scripts/package-release.sh`.
- It notarizes the exported app bundle, staples it, then creates signed `.zip` and `.dmg` artifacts.
  - Use the `.dmg` as the primary manual-install artifact.
  - Keep the `.zip` available for update/distribution workflows that still expect it.
- It applies the repo-tracked DMG installer layout and generated branded background during packaging, so local and CI builds share the same installer presentation without depending on a checked-in static poster image.
- It publishes those assets to the matching GitHub Release for a `v*` tag.
- It is safe to rerun after a partially failed publish; the workflow reuses the existing tag release, re-uploads assets with `--clobber`, and then updates the final draft / prerelease state.

If you have an individual Apple Developer account, that is fine: you do not need a company account for this flow. You do need a `Developer ID Application` certificate. A plain `Apple Development` certificate is not enough for signed, notarized downloads distributed outside the Mac App Store.

### Required repository secrets

Set these in `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions`:

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded `.p12` export of your `Developer ID Application` certificate |
| `P12_PASSWORD` | Password used when exporting the `.p12` |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the temporary CI keychain |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email used for notarization |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer Team ID |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for `notarytool` |

Optional secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SPARKLE_APPCAST_URL` | Feed URL compiled into the app for Sparkle update checks |
| `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_ED_KEY` | Public EdDSA key compiled into the app for Sparkle validation |

### Export the signing certificate

1. Open `Keychain Access`.
2. Export the `Developer ID Application` identity as a `.p12`.
3. Base64-encode it:

```bash
base64 -i developer-id-application.p12 | pbcopy
```

4. Paste the result into the `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` secret.

### Trigger the workflow

1. Create release notes at `releases/notes/<version>.md`.
   - Use `releases/notes/README.md` as the authoring template.
2. Make sure the app version matches the release tag.
3. Push a tag like `v0.0.1`, or open the workflow manually with the same tag name.

The workflow will upload the signed `.dmg` and `.zip` to the matching GitHub Release and add a short note that the artifacts were signed and notarized in CI.
The Actions run itself now exposes separate DMG, ZIP, and Linux bridge artifacts, although GitHub still wraps each artifact download in its own outer `.zip`.

## Local Sparkle release flow

If you want the full local release path including Sparkle appcast generation and website update:

1. Copy `Config/LocalSecrets.example.xcconfig` to `Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`.
2. Fill in:
   - `SPARKLE_APPCAST_URL`
   - `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_ED_KEY`
3. Generate Sparkle signing keys if you have not already:

```bash
./scripts/generate-keys.sh
```

4. Store notarization credentials locally:

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "PingIsland" \
  --apple-id "your@email.com" \
  --team-id "YOURTEAMID" \
  --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

5. Create the notarized DMG, appcast, and release assets:

```bash
./scripts/create-release.sh
```

## Notes

- `Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig` is intentionally gitignored.
- `scripts/package-release.sh` is the shared build + sign + notarize packaging entrypoint used by both local release tooling and GitHub Actions.
- `scripts/create-release.sh` packages `releases/notes/<version>.md` as `PingIsland-<version>.md` and uses it as the GitHub Release body when present.
- The app prefers Markdown release notes and falls back to Sparkle's explicit release notes links when Markdown is unavailable.
