# Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 5, 2026

Ping Island is a macOS utility for monitoring AI coding sessions from the macOS
menu bar. This policy explains what information the app handles and how it is
used.

## Data Collection

Ping Island does not sell personal information, does not use advertising
tracking, and does not include third-party analytics in the app.

The app is designed to process session information locally on your Mac. The
developer does not operate a Ping Island cloud service for the Mac App Store
build, and the app does not send your coding session data to the developer.

## Data Processed Locally

To provide its core features, Ping Island may process information on your Mac
such as:

- AI coding session status, events, prompts, responses, approvals, questions,
  errors, and completion notifications.
- Project, terminal, tmux, IDE, SSH, and session identifiers used to show the
  right session and jump back to the right workspace.
- Configuration files for supported local tools, including Claude Code, Codex,
  Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor, Qoder,
  CodeBuddy, WorkBuddy, GitHub Copilot, and compatible hook-driven tools.
- User preferences such as display mode, sounds, shortcuts, mascot settings,
  and integration settings.

This information is used to display session state, install or update local
integrations you enable, route notifications, and return focus to related
terminal or IDE windows.

## Permissions

Ping Island may request macOS permissions needed for its features, including:

- File access to user-selected folders or tool configuration locations.
- Apple Events or Accessibility access for window focus and terminal jump-back
  behavior.
- Local network permissions for hook and bridge communication between supported
  tools and the app.

You can manage these permissions in macOS System Settings.

## Remote SSH Features

If you enable remote SSH support, Ping Island uses the SSH target information
you provide to connect to the selected host, install or remove the remote bridge
when requested, and forward session events back to the local Ping Island app.
Remote SSH information and forwarded session events are used for this feature
and are not sent to the developer.

## Diagnostics

Ping Island may let you export diagnostics for troubleshooting. Diagnostic
exports are user-initiated, saved to a location you choose, and are intended to
redact secrets where possible. Review diagnostic files before sharing them in a
GitHub issue or support request.

## Third-Party Services

Ping Island can work with third-party developer tools and services that you
install or configure separately. Those tools, remote hosts, Apple services,
GitHub, and any AI providers you use have their own privacy practices. This
policy only covers Ping Island itself.
